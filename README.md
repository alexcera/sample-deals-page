###Sample Deals Page with Countdown Timer
===

#####What is this?
> An experimental page which shows a countdown timer, same as what you see in websites about flash deals.

===
#####Where can I see it?
[Live Demo](http://alexcera.github.io/sample-deals-page/)

===
#####Technology-Stack
* `HTML5/CSS3`
* plain `javascript`
* [`c4timer.js`](https://github.com/alexcera/c4timer.js), of course! 

===
#####Some Thoughts on Implementation
* I used a css-reset to neutralize browser-related DOM rendering mechanisms.
* As an example for deadline, the page automatically considers tomorrow's date as it's deadline for the countdown.
